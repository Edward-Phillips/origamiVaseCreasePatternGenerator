# Crease Pattern Generator


the objective of this this project is to produce a tool that can be used to generate a crease pattern for a given cross section of an origami vase.
It has been made using react.

In simple terms, a crease pattern is what you get if you unfold an origami model and draw a line over all the folds on the paper.

The inspiration for this project comes from the work done by Rebecca Glieseking: [http://rebecca.gieseking.us/](http://rebecca.gieseking.us/). I have also used [this guide](https://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/tutorials/svg/interactive/dragging/) to help me understand how to use react to create a draggable svg.
