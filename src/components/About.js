      Hi, I'm Ed. I'm a junior developer with experience in both Frontend & Backend development. I studied Aerospace engineering at university, worked a stint in customer support & finance before settling down as a developer. My passion is development however I also put a lot of energy into my hobbies - the main one being Origami, though I'm also learning to play chess & have recently branched out into a couple of new hobbies: Metalcasting & whittling.
