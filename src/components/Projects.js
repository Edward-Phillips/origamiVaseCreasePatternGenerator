        this is the Projects component, I'm going to use the github API to
        populate this page, so again, going to need a backend to process that -
        not sure what language to do the backend in, recently I have been
        working mostly in javascript/react on the frontend and PHP (laravel) on
        the backend. I kind of want to get good with Python so maybe something
        in Django or Flask - or just use Express, it's what you know?
      </div>
    </section>
  );
